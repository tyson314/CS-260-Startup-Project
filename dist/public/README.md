# CS-260-Startup-Project

This was very helpful. The git command terminology has always confused me. I also thought branches were dumb and
would just cause problems. The the functionality of gitlens and vscode made it easier to handle.

The idea I have for my web start up is a creative sandbox. When I say sandbox, I mean a literal sandbox. The core mechanic will be spawning colored
sand particles that fall to the ground and stack one on top of the other. By manipulating color and brush size, the user can make designs and patterns
with the sand. There will be features that allow users to sign in, save their sand creations, load previous art, and share their sandbox with other users.
There will be a browse gallery mechanic as well that allows you to view content from other artists!

Key Features:
Interactive Sand Art
Changeable Color Palette
Secure Sign In
Save Designs on Web Server to Share or Access Later
Send, View, and Download Work from Others

My mind is being absolutely blown. The internet makes so much more 
sense now. I can't wait to make something cool on it.

Simon HTML
This assignment was soooo helpful. It is clicking in my head how the 
structural tags relate with each other (head, header, body, footer, etc). 
It was good to get a lot of repitition. I got a little practice doing 
everything like tables, graphics, lots of links, and some input too. 
I figure it will be a lot harder to come up with an original work, 
but for the most part I understand what is going on in simon. The only 
parts that are still confusing are the arbitraty IDs, the svg tags, 
and what the numbers mean in the form section.

Simon CSS
I'm not going to lie this frameworks and CSS stuff has had me confused
out of my mind. I'm not the artsy-est person in the world so I was really
dreading making my startup look aesthetically pleasing. After going through
the Simon code I'm still a little nervous, but I think I have a handle on how
to use bootstrap now. The class declarations in the html part of things make
more sense, like they are referencing premade CSS definitions elsewhere or 
something. I am rethinking my startup idea though, I want to make something
a little more structured and less interactive.

Simon JavaScript
JavaScript has been very hard for me to get the hang of. There seems to be
too few rules it that makes sense. The fact that variables and parameters and 
functions are so flexible make it really hard to code without a million bugs.
That being said, this project has helped me see the versatility and power of 
reassignable and storeable functions, especially those involved in promises. In 
a web page, it's not a systematical algorithm that is done only one way depending
on the input. It thrives of interactibility, something I have never really 
done before. I am hoping the experienced I gained recoding Simon will help me
with my own start-up.

Startup HTML/CSS

This was tough for me. An absolute monster of an assignment. However, I think I
learned more toughing through this than any other programming assignment I've 
done. I spent a lot of time reading about flex boxes and bootstrap tags, how
they interact with each other, how to override them, etc. I also understand a
how to structure an html file to be conducive to the kind of content you want
to present. The trick is making an extra layer to be a flex container and then
the elements inside are easier to manipulate. I had a lot of trouble with the 
min-width attrubite so I ended up using extra media restrictions instead, and
I think it turned out better! I haven't implemented my browse section yet 
because I don't know what functionality I can implement simply with the back
end connectivity part of things. However, it will be fast since I already know 
how to do it.

Simon Service

This was a really helpful assignment. It really breaks down how simple a service can
really be by using the express package. It made handling post and get requests
transform into a meager 3 or 4 lines. If anything this project made me understand how
useful it can be to use other peoples code. Well don't take this the wrong way. I mean
by downloading functional packages through the node.js methods or by using things like
fetch. What would have taken me days to code on my own we included in just a few lines as
well. Now I just need to decide how I will implement all of this in my start up project.

Simon MongoDB

This project was kind of hard for me to wrap my head around. I think the environmental
variables were a little tricky especially since I had to put them in two different
places. It makes sense though that you don't want them physically in your code, a lot
like protecting from SQL injection attacks. Overall very helpful and I think I know how I
will implement this into my startup.

Startup Javascript

I went from despising javascript at the beginning of this project to actually really
enjoying it. The function based coding style really allows for you to make super
generic code that can be applied in many situations. For example, my team changer and
player changers use 90% of the same code but each function very independently of each
other. I also think JSON is a really practical since it can be accessed through so many
different mediums. Another thing I like about javascript is the versatility that comes
built into arrays and objects. I essentially made a mini database of players, and used
a class to instantiate teams, and arrays to keep track of which players were selected.

Simon Login

A lot of these concepts were pretty familiar because we dealt with them in 240. Something
I thought was interesting and had never really crossed my mind is hashing the password
before storing it into the database. It prevents information loss and a good hash 
would be just as authentic as the original password. Something else I learned was how 
to use the different service endpoints to log a user in. The Login and Create requests
are intuitive but passing an authtoken to get certain types of data or authorization was
an interesting concept. I will try and keep my implementation simple, but one day it would
be cool to explore all the possibilities of authentication implementation.

Simon WebSocket

I'm trying to figure out how useful webSocket will be to my startUp application. I don't have
a ton of peer to peer communication so I might just have to make something up. I could 
likely do something similar to what is found in this demonstration where you just announce
the events of other players. It blows my mind that you can add so much functionality and
communication with just a small source code. It is really important that you handle all the 
connections effectively on coming in and out of your socket. I can only imagine the bugs that
would show up if you had a wrong connection or you tried sending a message to a closed 
connection.

Simon React

This was an animal. I am very very very grateful we did not have to convert our entire startup
project over to use react. This was very helpful to see how things worked. The routing makes
a lot more sense not. Everything is using the same webpage, but essentially taken down and 
reloaded when using the nav bar up top. I learned a lot about using the HTML and bootstrap
in the JSX file. It is interesting that we use className, but it makes sense because it 
is still javascript. It will be hard to recreate a lot of the logic that was originally so
simple in javascript when using react, involving hooks and the works. While I was learning 
about react in the unit I was confused about why anyone would want to use this instead of
HTML, CSS, and javascript, but after seeing how smoothly the new simon application runs I 
need no further convincing.
