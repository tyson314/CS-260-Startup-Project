This was very helpful. The git command terminology has always confused me. I also thought branches were dumb and
would just cause problems. The the functionality of gitlens and vscode made it easier to handle.

The idea I have for my web start up is a creative sandbox. When I say sandbox, I mean a literal sandbox. The core mechanic will be spawning colored
sand particles that fall to the ground and stack one on top of the other. By manipulating color and brush size, the user can make designs and patterns
with the sand. There will be features that allow users to sign in, save their sand creations, load previous art, and share their sandbox with other users.
There will be a browse gallery mechanic as well that allows you to view content from other artists!
