This was very helpful. The git command terminology has always confused me. I also thought branches were dumb and
would just cause problems. The the functionality of gitlens and vscode made it easier to handle.

The idea I have for my web start up is a creative sandbox. When I say sandbox, I mean a literal sandbox. The core mechanic will be spawning colored
sand particles that fall to the ground and stack one on top of the other. By manipulating color and brush size, the user can make designs and patterns
with the sand. There will be features that allow users to sign in, save their sand creations, load previous art, and share their sandbox with other users.
There will be a browse gallery mechanic as well that allows you to view content from other artists!

Key Features:
Interactive Sand Art
Changeable Color Palette
Secure Sign In
Save Designs on Web Server to Share or Access Later
Send, View, and Download Work from Others

My mind is being absolutely blown. The internet makes so much more 
sense now. I can't wait to make something cool on it.

Simon HTML
This assignment was soooo helpful. It is clicking in my head how the 
structural tags relate with each other (head, header, body, footer, etc). 
It was good to get a lot of repitition. I got a little practice doing 
everything like tables, graphics, lots of links, and some input too. 
I figure it will be a lot harder to come up with an original work, 
but for the most part I understand what is going on in simon. The only 
parts that are still confusing are the arbitraty IDs, the svg tags, 
and what the numbers mean in the form section.

Simon CSS
I'm not going to lie this frameworks and CSS stuff has had me confused
out of my mind. I'm not the artsy-est person in the world so I was really
dreading making my startup look aesthetically pleasing. After going through
the Simon code I'm still a little nervous, but I think I have a handle on how
to use bootstrap now. The class declarations in the html part of things make
more sense, like they are referencing premade CSS definitions elsewhere or 
something. I am rethinking my startup idea though, I want to make something
a little more structured and less interactive.
