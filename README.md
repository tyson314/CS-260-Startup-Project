This was very helpful. The git command terminology has always confused me. I also thought branches were dumb and
would just cause problems. The the functionality of gitlens and vscode made it easier to handle.

The idea I have for my web start up is a creative sandbox. When I say sandbox, I mean a literal sandbox. The core mechanic will be spawning colored
sand particles that fall to the ground and stack one on top of the other. By manipulating color and brush size, the user can make designs and patterns
with the sand. There will be features that allow users to sign in, save their sand creations, load previous art, and share their sandbox with other users.
There will be a browse gallery mechanic as well that allows you to view content from other artists!

Key Features:
Interactive Sand Art
Changeable Color Palette
Secure Sign In
Save Designs on Web Server to Share or Access Later
Send, View, and Download Work from Others

My mind is being absolutely blown. The internet makes so much more 
sense now. I can't wait to make something cool on it.

Simon HTML
This assignment was soooo helpful. It is clicking in my head how the 
structural tags relate with each other (head, header, body, footer, etc). 
It was good to get a lot of repitition. I got a little practice doing 
everything like tables, graphics, lots of links, and some input too. 
I figure it will be a lot harder to come up with an original work, 
but for the most part I understand what is going on in simon. The only 
parts that are still confusing are the arbitraty IDs, the svg tags, 
and what the numbers mean in the form section.

Simon CSS
I'm not going to lie this frameworks and CSS stuff has had me confused
out of my mind. I'm not the artsy-est person in the world so I was really
dreading making my startup look aesthetically pleasing. After going through
the Simon code I'm still a little nervous, but I think I have a handle on how
to use bootstrap now. The class declarations in the html part of things make
more sense, like they are referencing premade CSS definitions elsewhere or 
something. I am rethinking my startup idea though, I want to make something
a little more structured and less interactive.

Simon JavaScript
JavaScript has been very hard for me to get the hang of. There seems to be
too few rules it that makes sense. The fact that variables and parameters and 
functions are so flexible make it really hard to code without a million bugs.
That being said, this project has helped me see the versatility and power of 
reassignable and storeable functions, especially those involved in promises. In 
a web page, it's not a systematical algorithm that is done only one way depending
on the input. It thrives of interactibility, something I have never really 
done before. I am hoping the experienced I gained recoding Simon will help me
with my own start-up.

Startup HTML/CSS

This was tough for me. An absolute monster of an assignment. However, I think I
learned more toughing through this than any other programming assignment I've 
done. I spent a lot of time reading about flex boxes and bootstrap tags, how
they interact with each other, how to override them, etc. I also understand a
how to structure an html file to be conducive to the kind of content you want
to present. The trick is making an extra layer to be a flex container and then
the elements inside are easier to manipulate. I had a lot of trouble with the 
min-width attrubite so I ended up using extra media restrictions instead, and
I think it turned out better! I haven't implemented my browse section yet 
because I don't know what functionality I can implement simply with the back
end connectivity part of things. However, it will be fast since I already know 
how to do it.
